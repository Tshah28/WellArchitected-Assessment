    "context": "An error budget describes the maximum amount of time that the application can fail without consequence, and is typically calculated as 1-SLA. For example, if the SLA specifies that the application will function 99.99% of the time before the business has to compensate customers, the error budget is 52 minutes and 35 seconds per year. Error budgets are a device to encourage development teams to minimize real incidents and maximize innovation by taking risks within acceptable limits, given teams are free to ‘spend’ budget appropriately",
