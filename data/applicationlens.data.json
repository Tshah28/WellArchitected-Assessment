While zones provide greater resiliency than sets, there are performance and cost considerations where applications are extremely 'chatty' across zones given the implied physical separation and inter-zone bandwidth charges.

Perhaps baselines center around a certain number of visitors within a given time period, the time it takes to render a page, type  required for executing a stored procedure, or a desired number of transactions if your site conducts some type of e-commerce. It is important to identify and maintain a shared understanding of these baselines so that you can architect a system that meets them.<br />Baselines can vary based on types of connections or platforms that a user may leverage for accessing the application. It may be important to establish baselines that address the diversity of connections, platforms, and other elements (like time of day, or weekday versus weekend).",

Other customers that have service-related users (i.e. users who are paid for performance) may base their thresholds on the ability to keep the user working as fast as possible (mental state is not the primary motivator) because increased productivity typically increases revenue. Typically, most industry standards target page load times to 1-2 seconds, while 3-5 seconds is \"acceptable,\" and more than 5 is unacceptable.

    "context": "SSL offloading places the SSL certificate at an appliance that sits in front of the web server, instead of on the web server itself. This is beneficial for two reasons. First, the verification of the SSL certificate is conducted by the appliance instead of the web server, which reduces the taxation on the server. Second, SSL offloading increases operational efficiency as it can often eliminate the need to manage certificates across microservices.",

It really comes down to the 80/20 rule--generally, 80% of the application can be optimized by focusing on just 20%. While you can continue optimizing certain elements of the application, after optimizing the initial 20%, a company typically sees a diminishing return on any further optimization. The question the customer must answer is how much of the remaining 80% of the application is worth optimizing for the business. In other words, how much will optimizing the remaining 80% help the business reach its goals (e.g. customer acquisition/retention, sales, etc.)? The business must determine their own realistic definition of \"acceptable.\"",

Scaling the application vertical to a larger machine this is optimized for higher CPU or memory workloads may also be considered. Profiling the application code can be useful to find code structures that may be sub-optimal and replace them with better-optimized code. These decisions are a balance of several factors that can include cost, system complexity, and time to implement.",
