If a load test results in SNAT errors, it is necessary to either scale across more/larger workers, or implement coding practices to help preserve and re-use SNAT ports, such as connection pooling and the lazy loading of resources.It is recommended not to exceed 100 simultaneous outbound connections to a public IP Address per worker, and to avoid communicating with downstream services via public IP addresses when a private address (Private Endpoint) or Service Endpoint through vNet Integration could be used.TCP port exhaustion happens when the sum of connection from a given worker exceeds the capacity. The number of available TCP ports depend on the size of the worker. The following table lists the current limits:\n\n    > |  |Small (B1, S1, P1, I1)|Medium (B2, S2, P2, I2)|Large (B3, S3, P3, I3)|\n    > |---------|---------|---------|---------|\n    > |TCP ports|1920|3968|8064|\n\n    > Applications with lots of longstanding connections require ports to be left open for long periods of time, which can lead to TCP Connection exhaustion. TCP Connection limits are fixed based on instance size, so it is necessary to scale up to a larger worker size to increase the allotment of TCP connections, or implement code level mitigations to govern connection usage. Similar to SNAT port exhaustion, Azure Diagnostics can be used to identify if a problem exists with TCP port limits."

If a pod does not meet conditions specified in the policy, Azure Policy can disallow the pod to start or flag a violation."
