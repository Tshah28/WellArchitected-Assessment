However, the application architecture must not share dependencies between zones to use them effectively. It is also important to note that Availability Zones may introduce performance and cost considerations for applications which are extremely 'chatty' across zones given the implied physical separation between each zone and inter-zone bandwidth charges ([Availability Zones](https: //docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview#availability-zones))",
