This might be the right time to talk through the STRIDE methodology and then the tools available to help them with Threat Modeling.  There are tools like [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool-getting-started) which can help.Determine if they understand the attack vectors of their solution with this question. Get them to discuss the defense in depth that they have around the identified threats and how they are detecting, protecting, and responding to a potential attack. Try to uncover how they identified the threats and communicated those to all interested parties or if rather are hoping no one finds out. This question should set the stage for the audience that needs to be involved and the topics that will be discussed throughout the assessment."
