[![Reliability Assessment](/templates/media/reliability-icon.png "Reliability Assessment")](#)

This reliability assessment has been produced to help the global CE&S community to identify key risks to the health and availability of applications built on Azure, providing key recommendations to better serve our customers.

> Please note it is assumed users of this guidance have familiarity with the application architecture in question, as well as key scenarios and non-functional requirements.
