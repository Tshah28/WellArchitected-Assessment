[![Reliability Assessment](/templates/media/performanceefficiency-icon.png "Performance Efficiency")](#)

This reliability assessment has been produced to help the global CE&S community to identify opportunities to reduce performance bottlenecks within an application built on Azure and to ensure that the application architecture meets design requirements for anticipated load key, providing key recommendations to better serve our customers.

> Please note it is assumed users of this guidance have familiarity with the application architecture in question, as well as key scenarios and non-functional requirements.
